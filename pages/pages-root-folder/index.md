## Introduction <i class="fa fa-user fa-1x"></i>
My name is Saurabh Kumar and I currently work as a Senior Software Engineer @ Cisco. I possess over 10 years of professional experience as a software developer in leading multinational product companies. I have a Master's degree in Computer Science from Texas A&M University(College Station) and a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science from Indian Institute of Technology (IIT). <br>

In my current role, I am focused on the development & extension of LLVM infrastructure to build tools and software for the improvement of high-performance DSP firmware. I am working on investigation & proposal of UBSan adaptation to support full runtime dynamic analysis in memory constrained embedded environments within the 5G domain. I also conceptualized several static analysis checkers to automatically identify and correct bug prone C code in the firmware. I collaborated with several teams to conceive feature extensions & integration of CodeChecker to facilitate static and dynamic analysis of entire C source code at Ericsson. Additionally, I proposed, built & deployed a tool to automatically format C source code according to Ericsson coding guidelines which resulted in significant reduction of customer issues due to incorrect programming practices. <br>

 Prior to my current role, I worked for 4.5 years as a Software Developer primarily in compiler technologies within the EDA domain. I worked as a Lead Developer at Mentor, A Siemens Business where I took ownership of the compiler driver software establishing my technical and leadership prowess. I was also completely responsible for implementing VHDL2008 and encryption capabilities to the VHDL compiler at Mentor. During my professional journey, I worked on highly complex software using state of the art technologies, best programming practices, design patterns and software development methodologies. I have an innate passion for research and constantly thrive to innovate and solve problems efficiently. <br>
 
 I am a consistent performer and thrive to excel in my career. Before starting my professional career, I cleared the prestigious Joint Entrance Examination(JEE) and got an admission into an IIT (Indian Institute of Technology) where I earned a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science & Engineering. During my Masters, I was the only Master's student to be offered the Graduate Assistant position twice consecutively due to my excellent performance in teaching undergraduate students. I also invented an autograding software to grade the programming assignments of students automatically which helped in providing prompt feedback and grades to the students and reduced the manual grading overhead on the instructors. <br>

When I am not on the job, I like to travel, listen to music and sip coffee. I am a fitness enthusiast and try to work out regularly. I also like to cook and invent new recipes every once in a while for my partner. <br>

Lastly, I participate in social causes whenever possible. Here in Austin, I have volunteered at the Central Texas Food Bank multiple times. I try to give back within my means in various areas, but in the long term, I want to create an impact on the society through education. I believe that a more educated society will make the world a better place. I am a member of the Indian Red Cross Society and have volunteered for donation drives and relief work during natural disasters. I also volunteered as a tutor in a Nonprofit organization named Kashi Utkarsh during my undergraduate. Currently, I want to focus on my career goals and improve my skills to achieve professional excellence, which I plan to use to make a positive impact on the society in future.
