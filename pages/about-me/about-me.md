## Introduction <i class="fa fa-user fa-1x"></i>
Welcome to my digital realm, fellow learners! I am Saurabh Kumar, a seasoned Compiler Engineer and enthusiast of all things tech. Join me on an exhilarating journey through the intricate world of compilers and LLVM, where we'll explore the depths of code analysis, code optimization, machine code generation, symbolic execution, dynamic analysis and the ever-evolving landscape of software sorcery.

Through my blog, I aim to share my expertise and insights garnered from over a decade of traversing the interesting realms of compilers and other things software. Delving into the esoteric realms of static and dynamic analysis techniques using the LLVM infrastructure, I'll unravel my learnings for efficient code analysis and compiler optimizations.

But my passions extend beyond the arcane arts of compiler development using the LLVM infrastructure. From the halls of compiler development for HDL languages in the Electronic Design Automation (EDA) domain to the captivating worlds of FPGA prototyping in the EDA domain, I'll delve into a myriad of topics, sharing my experiences and knowledge every step of the way.

So grab your enchanted scrolls and embark on this quest of discovery with me. Together, let's unlock the mysteries of technology and embark on an adventure of learning, growth, and endless fascination."
